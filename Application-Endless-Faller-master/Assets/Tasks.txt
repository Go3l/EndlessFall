- Set Limits where Player lose the Game - (5min)
- Score when player cross a platform - (5min)
- Creating a Pool system for platforms - (15min)
- instantiating prefabs of platforms - (15min)
- resizing randomly Moving Platform - (10min)
- Game Over - (15min)
- uiManager - (30min)


- Problems that I ran into:

- Change the pivot of the cubes to make the random sizing work. *(I created an empty parent object for each of the platforms,
changing the position of each platform and then just resizing the parent object to resize the desired side of the cube)

- Stop Player going through walls *(I Limited the movement of the player to avoid touching the walls)

- When I set the Scoring Up, I was checking the position of player and platform ( when the player.position.y < platform.position.y, should score up), I had unexpected behaviors,
like repetition of scoring up even using bools to avoid it,so I decided to set it with colliders ( OnCollisionExit).
